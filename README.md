## ChatScope: WhatsApp Chat Analysis Dashboard
A Python-powered dashboard that extracts and visualizes key insights from exported WhatsApp chats — revealing user activity, message patterns, and conversational dynamics.

## 🎯 Short Description / Purpose
ChatScope is a data analysis tool designed to uncover hidden patterns in WhatsApp conversations. It helps users explore message frequency, media sharing, word usage, and user engagement through interactive visualizations and statistical summaries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 🐍 Python – Core programming language for data processing and logic
• 📚 Pandas – Data manipulation and structuring
• 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn – For generating charts and activity maps
• 🌐 Streamlit – Web framework for building the interactive dashboard
• 🧹 Custom Preprocessing Scripts – Includes preprocessor.py and stop_hinglish.txt for cleaning and tokenizing chat data
• 📁 File Format – .txt for WhatsApp chat exports; .py for analysis scripts

## 📚 Data Source
Source: Exported WhatsApp chat file (.txt)
The chat data includes timestamps, sender names, message content, media indicators, and links. It is preprocessed to extract structured insights such as word counts, emoji usage, and activity timelines.

## 🔍 Features / Highlights
### • Business Problem
Group chats and personal conversations on WhatsApp contain rich behavioral data, but raw exports are hard to interpret. Users lack tools to quantify engagement, identify top contributors, or visualize chat dynamics.
### • Goal of the Dashboard
To build a user-friendly dashboard that:
- Analyzes message volume, media sharing, and link frequency
- Identifies most active users and peak chat times
- Visualizes word clouds and emoji usage
- Maps activity across days, months, and hours
## • Walkthrough of Key Visuals
### - Top KPIs:
Total messages, media shared, links sent, and word count
### - Most Active Users (Bar Chart):
Ranks users by message volume
### - Monthly & Daily Timeline (Line Charts):
